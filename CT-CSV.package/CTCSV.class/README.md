Class to load a CSV file (with headers). Data stored as an OrderedCollection containing a set of dictionaries - one for each line -> keys are the header values and therefore are assumed to be the first row in the file.

Because NeoCSVReader processes all fields as strings (unless you specify otherwise) we need to supply a specification (we call it a schema) that describes what format the fields are - basically string or number ('str' / 'num' respectively). The _schema_ will be supplied in the form of an array of associations.
